In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model that can predict the profit of a company based on its R&amp;D Spend, Administration Cost, and Marketing Spend. We will explore various regression algorithms, divide the dataset into training and testing sets, calculate different regression metrics, and select the best-performing model.
